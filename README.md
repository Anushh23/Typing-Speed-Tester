# Typing-Speed-Tester
DESCRIPTION
---------------
* Typing is one of the most underrated skills of the developer. The ability to quickly transfer thoughts from your head to your editor allows creativity to flow freely. One of the best ways to learn is to play a game!

* The typing speed game/tester has been created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

* The game will present the user with a random paragraph and time how long the player takes to type it out accurately.
